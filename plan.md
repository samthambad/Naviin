# Objective

A CLI-native trading OS that tracks your portfolio, strategies,
and performance, eventually using crypto as the universal money layer.

This is aimed at technical beginners who want real-time prices and a safe way to learn trading fundamentals through paper trading, using a no-bloat command-line toolkit that teaches how portfolios and risk really work.

## Because currently, the alternatives are:

- overwhelming GUIs
- expensive quant platforms
- overly simplistic paper trading apps
- spreadsheets

## Sales pitch

- Paper trade with real market data

- Track positions, P&L, and risk precisely

- Build and test strategies incrementally

- Stay fully local and transparent
